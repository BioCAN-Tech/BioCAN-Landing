# Images Directory

This directory should contain the BioCAN logo file.

## Required Files:

### BioCAN_Logo.png
- **File**: `BioCAN_Logo.png`
- **Description**: Main BioCAN logo that appears in the navigation
- **Recommended size**: 200x200px minimum for crisp display
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background preferred
- **Usage**: Referenced in the navigation header as `images/BioCAN_Logo.png`

## Logo Design Guidelines:
- Should match the BioCAN branding seen in the Next.js version
- Transparent background for better integration with dark theme
- High resolution for crisp display on retina screens
- Should be recognizable at both large and small sizes

## Note:
Without the proper logo file, you'll see a broken image placeholder in the navigation. Once you add the `BioCAN_Logo.png` file to this directory, the logo will display properly and match the Next.js version exactly.

The logo should feature:
- "BioCAN" text in a modern, clean font
- Possibly incorporating science/bio-related visual elements
- Colors that work well with the blue/purple gradient theme
- Professional appearance suitable for a career platform

## File Structure

```

├── BioCAN_Logo.png (main logo file)
└── README.md (this file)
```

## Notes

- All image paths in the HTML files are set to `images/BioCAN_Logo.png`
- The logo should be optimized for web use
- Consider providing both a standard and retina version if needed
